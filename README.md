# Fruits Shop Website 🍎🍇

This is a responsive, single-page website for a hypothetical fruits shop. It is built using modern web development practices and features a clean, user-friendly design.

## Features

  * **Responsive Design:** 💻 The layout adjusts to fit various screen sizes, from desktop to mobile, using Flexbox and media queries.
  * **Single-Page Navigation:** 🔗 The navigation bar allows for smooth scrolling to different sections of the page (Home, Fruits, Services, Contact Us) using anchor links.
  * **"Go to Top" Button:** ⬆️ A fixed button appears in the corner, allowing users to quickly return to the top of the page with a smooth scrolling animation.
  * **Structured Sections:** 📄 The website is organized into distinct sections, including a welcome hero, services offered, fresh fruits showcase, testimonials, and a contact form.
  * **Consistent Styling:** ✨ The design uses a clear color palette with an orange primary color and consistent button hover effects.

## Technologies Used

  * **HTML:** 🌐 For the page structure and content.
  * **CSS:** 🎨 For styling, layout, and responsive design. This includes the use of `flexbox` and fluid units like `rem`, `em`, `vw`, and `vh`.
  * **JavaScript:** 🚀 A small script is embedded in the HTML to enable the smooth-scrolling functionality of the "Go to Top" button and to add interactivity to the hero buttons and contact form.
